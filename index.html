        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
        high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive
        for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing
        components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost
        of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code
        reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without
        charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
      <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is
        no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or
        bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an
        exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level
        debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting
        breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself,
        testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to
        add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very
        effective.</p>

        <h2>Why Python?</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
        <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
        <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming
          languages.</li>
        <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means
          that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
        <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Good to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However,
          Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.</li>
        <li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated
          Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when
          managing larger collections of Python files.</li>

        <h2>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from
          mathematics.</li>
        <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use
          semicolons or parentheses.</li>
        <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and
          classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Python Install</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>

      <p>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following
        on the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          C:\Users\<em>Your Name</em>&gt;python --version
          </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the
        Terminal and type:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          python --version
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the
        following website: <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a></p>

      <header>
        <h2>Python Quickstart</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a
        text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.</p>

      <p>The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          C:\Users\<em>Your Name</em>&gt;python helloworld.py
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.</p>

      <p>Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>helloworld.py</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          print("Hello, World!")
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file,
        and run:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          C:\Users\<em>Your Name</em>&gt;python helloworld.py
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>


      <p>The output should read:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          Hello, World!
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="the_python_command_line" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h2>The Python Command Line</h2>
      </header>

      <p>To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file.
        This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.</p>
      <p>Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          C:\Users\<em>Your Name</em>&gt;python
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          C:\Users\<em>Your Name</em>&gt;py
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          <span style="opacity:0.5">C:\Users\<em>Your Name</em>&gt;python<br>
            Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32<br>
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</span><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello, World!")
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
          <span style="opacity:0.5">C:\Users\<em>Your Name</em>&gt;python<br>
            Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32<br>
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.<br>
            &gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello, World!")</span><br>
          Hello, World!
        </code>
        </div>
      </div>


      <p>Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command
        line interface:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            exit()
          </code>
        </div>
